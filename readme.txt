In WordPress 3.0, a default filter changes all instances of "Wordpress" in posts, titles, and comments to "WordPress". This turns the filter off.

== Description ==

In WordPress 3.0, <a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/14996">a default filter</a> changes all instances of "Wordpress" (note the small "p") in posts, titles, and comments to "WordPress". <a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/13583">For various reasons</a>, such as preserving spelling in existing posts and comments, a blog owner may want to turn this filter off. That is what this plugin does.

Simply upload the plugin files to your WordPress plugins folder, activate it on your blog's Plugin administration page, and you are set!

It should be noted that this plugin REQUIRES WordPress version 3.0 or later. If you have any problems or questions, feel free to <a href="http://tomlany.net/2010/05/wordpress-to-wordpress/">leave a comment on my website</a>, and I will respond as I have time.
